# What is Instagraph?

In a nutshell, it uses the AI engine behind ChatGPT to generate knowledge graphs (e.g. mindmaps, supply/value chain diagrams) based on your input.

What this means is that you will be able to get up to speed on a new topic very quickly - think of all the times you needed a 2-min rundown of a new industry, business model, or process before jumping on to a meeting or event so that you can sound smart.

Instagraph is an open souce project created by Yohei Nakajima ([https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima)), who is best described as a "VC by day and builder by night".
